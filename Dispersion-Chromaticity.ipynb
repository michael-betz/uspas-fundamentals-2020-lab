    "In other labs, we simulate beamlines without dipoles. Dipoles create dispersion ($\\eta$ or D, depending who you talk to), which describes the evolution of transverse size for particles/beams that are off-momentum. Off-momentum particles experience a different force in the dipole than the design orbit, as they have different magnetic rigidity $B\\rho=\\frac{p}{q}$. Dispersion can be calculated as a function of s and can have a periodic (matched) solution, similar to the $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ functions.\n",
