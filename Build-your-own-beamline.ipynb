    "- You wont need much python specific code for this lab, but here are some tips:\n",
    "- Press shift+enter to execute a cell, or use the play button at the top of the window\n",
    "- Make sure you exectue cells in order, or re-exectue cells if you change something at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "- You can also exectue the whole notebook by using 'Run all cells' under the 'Run' tab.\n",

    "FODO is the most commonly-cited example of periodic transverse focusing, but it is far from the only option. Depending on the application, other configurations may be used. For example, light sources use optics optimized for dispersion-free regions. Collider rings require optics that create a small spot-size at the interaction point. \n",
