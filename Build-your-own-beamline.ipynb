    "### Python Notes: \n",
    "- You wont need much python specific code for this lab, but here are some tips:\n",
    "- Press shift+enter to execute a cell, or use the play button at the top of the window\n",
    "- Make sure you exectue cells in order, or re-exectue cells if you change something at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "- You can also exectue the whole notebook by using 'Run all cells' under the 'Run' tab.\n",

For example, light sources use optics optimized for dispersion-free regions. Collider rings require optics that create a small spot-size at the interaction point. \n",
